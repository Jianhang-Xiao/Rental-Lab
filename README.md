## Project Description 
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)
1. I needed to access the Excel file and used code to understand what's inside the Excelspreadsheet, such as columnis and rows, and what types of data.
2. Then I needed to explore data through histrgram, boxpot, and scatterplot. 
3. I also needed to clean data such as deleting the empty data and reduce any expreme data.
4. Used linear regression model to see how well the data fits. 
5 The blockers and challenges that I faced was connecting to Github by enter commends in Terminal. Some codes I did not know how to enter and took sometimes to figure out.
